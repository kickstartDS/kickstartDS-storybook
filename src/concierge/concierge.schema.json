      "default": "Hey there!\n\nA design system is a library of reusable components governed by a set a foundational standards, such as color, typography, and grid. Additionally, guidelines and documentation accompany all components along with guiding patterns and best practices. Teams are encouraged to leverage the system and its documentation to build repeatable designs within applications or interfaces.\n\nMy updated definition is as follows: A design system is the official story of how an organization designs and builds digital interfaces. It is a connected, package-managed, version-controlled software product that contains the smallest set of components and guidelines an organization needs to make digital products consistently, efficiently and happily.\n\nIf I have ~30 seconds in an elevator or over animated slides, I’ll lead with: Almost always, a design system offers a library of visual style and components documented and released as reusable code for developers and/or tool(s) for designers. A system may also offer guidance on accessibility, page layout, and editorial and less often branding, data viz, UX patterns, and other tools. A design system is adopted by and supported for other teams making experiences. These teams use it to develop and ship features more efficiently to form a more cohesive customer journey. A design system is made by an individual, team, and/or community. While some arise less formally, organizations now dedicate small to large squad(s) to develop and release system versions and processes over time."
